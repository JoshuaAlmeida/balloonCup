# Server for balloonCup

In this folder is where my express server is placed.
I created an API in express for that reason I deleted some folders (public and views) that were created when executed "express-generator"

* The steps that I did were:

 1. Create the folder server 
 2. Create the npm repo with command npm init 
 3. I installed express and all dependencies that are required like cookie parser
 4. I use the command express-generator to create a skeleton for the express server
